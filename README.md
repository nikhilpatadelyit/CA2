# CA2 â€“ Predictive modelling
Analyzing and dealing with the data related to the "HEART" for visualizing and predicting the functioning & working of the patients heart and implementing the predictive model for the chance of "HEART-ATTACK" with the variables present.
Data-set was same as earlier used in CA-1.
In this assessment we will be building a predictive model which will predict whether or not patient can get a heart attack using multiple predictor variables using the data provided. Since there are multiple predictor variables we will be using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) technique for analyzing and building a best predictive model.
